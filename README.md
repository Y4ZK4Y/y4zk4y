## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I write code. Sometimes it even works.
Mostly I just refactor the same thing 13 timess before realizing the third versiion was fine.

### About me
- **Software engineering student** who works in **cybersecurity**
- Engineering background, always curious about how things work
- Currently learning **C++** as an elaborate way to test my patience

I'm down to talk about security, cool stuff or whatever random thing you're passionate about.
Feel free to look around and judge silently.
